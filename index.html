This is played in the main menu, overworld, and in creative mode. This song creates a peaceful ambiance for the player during the game's safest, non-threatening moments.
      Whenever this song is played, many players, such as myself, reminisce about the simpler times in life when we were kids and didn't have much to worry about. 
                                         It mirrors the calm and safety found in these parts of the game.

<div style="background-color: rgba(131, 234, 124, 0.75); color: #000; padding: 10px; display: inline-block;">
  An open-world game where players can use their creativity to build anything they can imagine, with the option to increase the challenge by fight for survival or explore uninhabited land.
  <br><br>
  <b>Survival Mode</b><br>
  Players gather resources, manage health and hunger, and defend against hostile mobs.<br><br>
  <b>Creative Mode</b><br>
  Players have unlimited resources and can fly, focusing entirely on building and designing without danger.<br><br>
  <b>Hardcore Mode</b><br>
  Like Survival, but with permanent death. Once you die, the world is deleted.

Minecraft doesn't have a traditional linear story, but it does have a loose narrative arc players can follow.
The player wakes up in a new world with nothing. They can choose to gather any block to make their shelter, but they need wood to start crafting tools. 
Then, as they progress, they gather more materials (such as iron, diamonds, and more), explore the world more, and upgrade their base.
Eventually, when the player feels ready, they can create a portal to The End and defeat the Ender Dragon. The official ending of the game happens after the victory. 
A long poem appears on the screen reflecting on the playerâ€™s journey. A metaphor for creativity and self-discovery.
The player is then transported back to their world, where they can play indefinitely to their heart's content.

Minecraft strongly supports Ernest Lindley's idea that play acts as a mental adaptation and preparation for obstacles in the real world. 
Players gather materials, build shelter, and defend themselves in Survival Mode, which mimics the fundamental requirements of survival. 
As humans learn to adjust to unpredictable situations, the game enables adaptability and resilience through trial and error. 
Lindley's concept of play as both mastery and energetic expression is reflected in how the players still exercise mental energy by building
intricate systems and experimenting with design, even in Creative Mode. In the end, Minecraft serves as a virtual rehearsal area where users 
rehearse creativity, problem-solving, and flexibility in ways that are reminiscent of Lindley's psychological theory.
